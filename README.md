Initial data
------------
The data set on Bus ridership was chosen to be a focal data set, as I find improving public transportation one of the most interesting topics in regard to community sustainability and global environmental situation.

**Bus ridership**. File - RTA_Fixed_Route_Ridership.xlsx  
The data set shows bus routes ridership by month for the period of time from July 2014 to June 2015. There are 15 routes presented. All the routes are operated by the Regional Transportation Agency of Central Maryland (RTA).

I found two other data sets that could be combined with the data on bus ridership for further analysis:

**Rail ridership**. File - MTA_Rail_Ridership.xlsx  
Data shows weekday ridership by month for different types of rails: Metro, Light Rail, MARC Train. The average weekday ridership is indicative of the number of transit patrons making a one-way trip on any mode per weekday. This number is estimated and excludes holidays. Data is shown for the period of time from April 2007 to August 2015.

**Bus complaints**. File - Regional_Transportation_Agency_Complaints_by_Month__Service_and_Type.xlsx  
The data set presents number of complaints by month for fixed routes and paratransit trips. Complaints are divided into 13 types, and there is also field *Others* presented. Only complaints for Howard County are given. Data is shown for the period of time from July 2014 to June 2015.

Data application
----------------
I combined the data on Bus ridership with the data on Rail ridership and got a new data set *MTA_Rail_and_RTA_Fixed_Route_Ridership_combined.xlsx*. The process of combination is described in the file *Processing_documentation_ridership.docx*.
